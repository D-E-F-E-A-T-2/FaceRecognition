# Face Recognition
Face Recognition using Haar-Cascade Classifier, OpenCV, and Python

## Requirements
- Python 3.5
- OpenCV 3.1.0
- Numpy


## Outline ?

This project consist of 3 parts, which are:

1. Creating datasets (face_datasets.py)
2. Train the model (training.py)
3. Recognize faces (recog.py)

## Instructions

 - First run face_datasets.py to generate datasets. Make sure that it creates two folders('datasets' and 'trainer'). The 'datasets' folder contains the grayscale images.
 
 - Supply proper ID for the face before running training.py
 
 - Run recog.py and don't forget to set each person's face to unique ID.
 
 - If you have more face to be include, change the ID and run the code again.
